          <h3>How People Really (Like To) Work: Comparative Process Mining To Unravel Human Behavior</h3>

          <br />
          <p><b style="font-size: larger; ">Abstract:</b><br />Software forms an integral part of the most complex
            artifacts built by humans. Communication, production, distribution, healthcare, transportation, banking,
            education, entertainment, government, and trade all increasingly rely on systems driven by software. Such
            systems may be used in ways not anticipated at design time as the context in which they operate is
            constantly changing and humans may interact with them an unpredictable manner. However, at the same time, we
            are able to collect unprecedented collections of event data describing what people and organizations are
            actually doing. Recent developments in process mining make it possible to analyze such event data, thereby
            focusing on behavior rather than correlations and simplistic performance indicators. For example, event logs
            can be used to automatically learn end-to-end process models. Next to the automated discovery of the real
            underlying process, there are process mining techniques to analyze bottlenecks, to uncover hidden
            inefficiencies, to check compliance, to explain deviations, to predict performance, and to guide users
            towards &quot;better&quot; processes. Process mining reveals how people really work and often reveals what
            they would really like to do. Event-based analysis may reveal workarounds and remarkable differences between
            people and organizations. In his keynote, Wil van der Aalst highlights current research on comparative
            process mining. One can compare event data with normative process models and see where people deviate. Some
            of these deviations may be positive and one can learn from them. Other deviations may reveal inefficiencies,
            design flaws, or even fraudulent behavior. One can also use process cubes to compare different systems or
            groups of people. Through slicing, dicing, rolling-up, and drilling-down we can view event data from
            different angles and produce process mining results that can be compared.</p>

          <h3>End-User Software Engineering: Beyond the Silos</h3>

              href="ftp://ftp.cs.orst.edu/pub/burnett/icse14-EUSE-future-FOSE.pdf" target="_blank">Please find the paper

          <br />
          <p><b style="font-size: larger; ">Abstract:</b><br />End-user programming has become pervasive in our society,
            with end users programming simulations, courseware, spreadsheets, macros, mashups, and more. In this talk,
            we will consider what happens when we add to end-user programming environments consideration of the software
            lifecycle beyond the &quot;coding&quot; phase. Considering other phases is necessary, because there is ample
            evidence that the programs end users create are filled with errors. To help address this problem, we have
            been working on a software &quot;engineering&quot; methodology designed specifically for end users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the user may have no expertise or even interest in software engineering, we do not propose to
            transform end users into engineers. Rather, our approach is to tightly integrate elements of design,
            implementation, component integration, debugging, testing, and maintenance, supported behind the scenes by
            analysis and inferential reasoning, to help the user reason about the dependability of their software as
            they work with it, in a manner that respects the user's problem-solving directions to an extent
            unprecedented in existing software development environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this talk, we describe the present state of EUSE, and challenges in moving forward. We show the
            challenges of avoiding becoming over-siloed. We then show that focusing on the in-the-moment intents of
            end-user developers can be used to derive a number of promising directions forward for EUSE researchers, and
            how theories can help us further de-silo future EUSE research. Finally, we discuss how overcoming challenges
            for the future of end-user software engineering may also bring direct benefits to the future of “classic”
            software engineering. </p>
          <br />
          <p><b style="font-size: larger; ">Bio:</b><br />Margaret Burnett's research is in human issues of software
            development, which lies in the intersection of HCI and software engineering. Her current research focuses on
            end-user programming, end-user software engineering, information foraging theory as applied to programming,
            and gender issues in those contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            End-user software engineering is the first research area to rigorously consider the problem of dependability
            in end-user programming, and Burnett led in founding this research area. Her team's &quot;WYSIWYT&quot;
            systematic testing approach for end-user programmers initiated the groundwork, and in 2003, she co-founded
            and became Project Director of the EUSES Consortium. Under her leadership, this collaboration grew to 10
            institutions whose contributions have helped ordinary end users achieve up to 10 times greater effectiveness
            at guarding against software defects, receiving wide recognition for technical quality (11 Best Paper
            recognitions for the project).
          </p>
          <p>
            Burnett's awards for her own work include several Best Paper recognitions, IBM's International Faculty
            Award, and the NSF Young Investigator Award. She was recently honored with her university's Excellence in
            Graduate Mentoring Award, College of Engineering's Research Award, College of Engineering's Research
            Collaboration Award, and the Elizabeth P. Ritchie Distinguished Professor Award. She also serves on a
            variety of HCI and Software Engineering conference program committees, and currently co-chairs the Academic
            Alliance of the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT).</p>
